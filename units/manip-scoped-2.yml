title: Scoped verbs with predicates
theme: wrangle
needs: manip-scoped
desc: |
  In the previous scoped verbs unit, you learned about about the `_at` and `_all` 
  variants of `mutate()`, `transmute()`, `summarize()`, `select()`, and `rename()`.
  In this unit, you'll learn about the remaining scoped verbs: those that end in
  `_if` and `filter()`'s scoped variants.
