  Code style is simultaneously incredibly important and utterly trivial.
  It'slikepunctuation: sureyoucanmakedowithoutit, but proper punctuation
  can sure make things easier to read!
  
  When you're working with others, it's a really good idea to share a common
  style so that everyone can easily read and write the code. These readings will
  introduce you to a common style.

#  Install styler with `install.packages("styler")` and make sure you can
#  locate the RStudio addin command for restyling selected code. This will
#  make it very easy to apply the tidyverse style guide automatically.
