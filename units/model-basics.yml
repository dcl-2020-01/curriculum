  It's hard to understand data just by looking at it in a tibble. Visualizations
  are one way to gain a better understanding of the relationships present in
  your data. Modeling is another approach. 
  
  We're not going to rigorously cover the mathematical foundations of models. In
  this unit, we'll only cover the intuition for how models approximate data, as 
  well as how to conduct EDA when you know you're eventually going to fit a model.
