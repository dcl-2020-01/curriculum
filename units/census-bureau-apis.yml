desc: |
  Previously, you learned how to use the tidycensus package to access ACS and
  decennial census data. To access yearly population data between decennial census
  years, however, you'll need to work directly with the Census Bureau's
  Population Estimates APIs. In this unit, we'll cover accessing data directly 
  from APIs, and then discuss the Population Estimates APIs in more detail.
