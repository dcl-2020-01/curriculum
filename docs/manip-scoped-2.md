# Scoped verbs with predicates <small class='wrangle'>[wrangle]</small>
<small>(Builds on: [Scoped verb basics](manip-scoped.md))</small>

In the previous scoped verbs unit, you learned about about the `_at` and `_all` 
variants of `mutate()`, `transmute()`, `summarize()`, `select()`, and `rename()`.
In this unit, you'll learn about the remaining scoped verbs: those that end in
`_if` and `filter()`'s scoped variants.
